| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| problem_child | you need a little bit bruth force (1~255 times). nc functf 18001 |
| remote_32_first	| 17.10 call stack is different from 16.04. NO need to leak, nc functf 18002 |
| remote_32_babe | if you pass the first step, just add some leaks. Need to leak, NO BF! nc functf 18003	|
| remote_64_next | In 64bit, functions use register for args. use good gadgets nc functf 18004	|
| remote_64_babe | Leak libc address with rop gadgets. nc functf 18005|
| stack_easy | stack is always easy one. nc functf 18006	exp_stack_easy
| start_fms	| FMS bug can read stack value. nc functf 18007|
| bss_fms | FMS bug can change BSS value. nc functf 18008|
| bss_fms2 | Cause of compiler, task becomes harder but you can do it. had to patch it. could not use DTORS, used GOT. nc functf 18009|
| bss_fms_easy | one of the easist format string bug. nc functf 18010|
| start_heap | Heap starts. nc functf 18011|
| twin_heap |	Full Relo and Partial Relo are different. nc functf 18012|
| login_heap | Is it funny? I think it's funny. nc functf 18013|
| triple_heap | Let's start a easy fastbin. nc functf 18014|
| start_nw |	Time base random. It is vulnerable. CDLL is helpful.(Asia/Seoul) nc functf 18015	|
| test_your_name |	gets() cannot read the following '\n'(0x0a) characters. nc functf 18016	|
| test_blind_fms |	blind is not a real blind.nc functf 18017	|
| test_heap | unsafed unlink(16.04, 17.10).nc functf 18018	|
| ad_stack |	ref. realpath() bug, socat and xinet.d, their stack is different. It need a little BF. nc functf 18019	|
| ad_stack_babe |	realpath() bug 2. You CAN use ad_stack exploit. Don't u? nc functf 18020	|
| ad_stack_cript | usual stack overflow.nc functf 18021	|
| triple_heap_babe | twin heap -> use fast bins. nc functf 18022	|
